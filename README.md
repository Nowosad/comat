The goal of **comat** is to create co-occurrence matrices based on
spatial data, including a weighted co-occurrence matrix (*wecoma*) and
an integrated co-occurrence matrix (*incoma*).

## Installation

You can install the released version of **comat** from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("comat")
```

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Nowosad/comat")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to create a weighted
co-occurrence matrix (*wecoma*) based on two simple rasters (for
simplicity presented as matrices). The first one `raster_x` represents
some categories, and the second one `raster_w` represents weights.

``` r
library(comat)
library(raster)
#> Loading required package: sp
data(raster_x, package = "comat")
data(raster_w, package = "comat")
raster_x
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    1    1    3
#> [2,]    1    3    3
#> [3,]    2    2    3
raster_w
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    2    2    9
#> [2,]    6    4    9
#> [3,]    4    8    9
```

The `get_wecoma()` function can be next used to create a weighted
co-occurrence matrix.

``` r
get_wecoma(
  raster_x,
  raster_w,
  neighbourhood = 4
)
#>      1    2    3
#> 1 12.0  5.0 13.5
#> 2  5.0 12.0 14.5
#> 3 13.5 14.5 49.0
```

This function allows for some parametrization using additional
arguments, e.g.:

``` r
get_wecoma(
  raster_x,
  raster_w,
  neighbourhood = 4,
  fun = "focal",
  na_action = "keep"
)
#>    1  2  3
#> 1 12  6 10
#> 2  4 12 16
#> 3 17 13 49
```
